There are a variety of open, standardized options, and the ideal choice depends on the applications requirements and pre-existing functionality. For example, SOAP-based web services format the data in an XML payload wrapped within a SOAP envelope. While XML works well for many application scenarios, it has some drawbacks that make it less than ideal for others. One such space where XML is often less than ideal is with Ajax-style web applications. Ajax is a technique used for building interactive web applications that provide a snappier user experience through the use of out-of-band, lightweight calls to the web server in lieu of full-page postbacks. These asynchronous calls are initiated on the client using JavaScript and involve formatting data, sending it to a web server, and parsing and working with the returned data. While most browsers can construct, send, and parse XML, JavaScript Object Notation (or JSON) provides a standardized data exchange format that is better-suited for Ajax-style web applications. JSON is an open, text-based data exchange format (see RFC 4627). Like XML, it is human-readable, platform independent, and enjoys a wide availability of implementations. Data formatted according to the JSON standard is lightweight and can be parsed by JavaScript implementations with incredible ease, making it an ideal data exchange format for Ajax web applications. Since it is primarily a data format, JSON is not limited to just Ajax web applications, and can be used in virtually any scenario where applications need to exchange or store structured information as text. This article examines the JSON standard, its relationship to JavaScript, and how it compares to XML. Jayrock, an open-source JSON implementation for .NET, is discussed and examples of creating and parsing JSON messages are provided in JavaScript and C#.\",\n      \"votes\": 0,\n      \"topic\": \"coding\",\n      \"author\": \"cooljmessy\",\n      \"created_at\": \"2016-10-29T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"comment_count\": \"8\"\n    }, {\n      \"article_id\": 35,\n      \"title\": \"Stone Soup\",\n      \"body\": \"The first day I put my family on a Paleolithic diet, I made my kids fried eggs and sausage for breakfast.

Roy had many faults but the biggest frustration for me was he failed to utilise an already diminished pool of English players by continuing to pick the so called elite players – who are all tainted with failure. To be fair to Allardyce his first England game came so early in the season that it made making whole sale changes difficult. We shall never know if he would have picked different players.

He just didn’t know who to play in left midfield. The player would have to combat Bayern Munich’s brilliant Arjen Robben and Philipp Lahm. Going into the last team meeting, Di Matteo had a private chat with his left-back, Ashley Cole. He outlined the situation, then asked Cole who he would play at left-midfield. Instead of naming a seasoned star, Cole said: “Ryan Bertrand.” The 22-year-old reserve Bertrand had never played in the Champions League, let alone in club football’s biggest game. “Why?” asked Di Matteo, surprised. “I trust him,” replied Cole. Bertrand played well, and Chelsea beat Bayern on penalties. In part, this was a victory for talent management. Di Matteo had put aside his ego, and let trust between two players drive the decision. Talent management has been a business obsession at least since 1997, when the consultancy McKinsey identified a “war for talent”. The most visible battleground of this “war” is team sport. Football, in particular, is “the quintessential model for modern-day talent-dependent business”, writes Chris Brady, professor at Salford Business School. Big football clubs pay more than half their revenues to between 3 and 7 per cent of their workforce: the players. These young men are rich, multinational, mobile, often equipped with large egos and therefore hard to manage. Football managers are, above all, talent managers.\",\n      \"votes\": 0,\n      \"topic\": \"football\",\n      \"author\": \"jessjelly\",\n      \"created_at\": \"2017-04-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"comment_count\": \"5\"\n    }, {\n      \"article_id\": 19,\n      \"title\": \"Who are the most followed clubs and players on Instagram?\",\n      \"body\": \"Manchester United are the UK's most popular club on Instagram, with over 14m people following their account for their latest photos and videos.

Teams or fans can also assess how much pressure their team exerted on the opposition in deep positions, and who knows, perhaps in time we will be able to assess the effectiveness that individual players have on the ability of their team to press.

Cameras alone can’t process all these stats. So companies employ people — mostly young, mostly male, most logging matches in their spare time as a second job — to watch matches and document every event. Their work has helped develop stats that capture the value of players who don’t score many goals, but who set them up with pinpoint passing and hustle. Teams use advanced stats to decide which players to buy and put on the pitch.

FC Barcelona, also known simply as Barcelona and familiarly as Barça, is based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. The team was founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, English and Spanish footballers led by Joan Gamper. The club played amateur football until 1910 in various regional competitions. In 1910, the club participated in their first of many European competitions, and has since amassed ten UEFA trophies and a sextuple. In 1928, Barcelona co-founded La Liga, the top-tier in Spanish football, along with a string of other clubs. As of 2016, Barcelona has never been relegated from La Liga, a record they share with Athletic Bilbao and arch-rival Real Madrid. The history of Barcelona has often been politically. Though it is a club created and run by foreigners, Barcelona gradually became a club associated with Catalan values. In Spain's transition to autocracy in 1925, Catalonia became increasingly hostile towards the central government in Madrid. The hostility enhanced Barcelona's image as a focal point for Catalonism, and when Francisco Franco banned the use of the Catalan language, the stadium of Barcelona became one of the few places the people could express their dissatisfaction. The Spanish transition to democracy in 1978 has not dampened the club's image of Catalan pride. In the 2000s – a period of sporting success in the club and an increased focus on Catalan players – club officials have openly called for Catalonia to become an independent state.\",\n      \"votes\": 0,\n      \"topic\": \"football\",\n      \"author\": \"weegembump\",\n      \"created_at\": \"2018-02-17T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"comment_count\": \"16\"\n    }, {\n      \"article_id\": 27,\n      \"title\": \"Thanksgiving Drinks for Everyone\",\n      \"body\": \"Thanksgiving is a foodie’s favorite holiday.

The term pub league can also be used, due to the number of public houses that enter teams. Sunday leagues are sanctioned by the local County Football Association. There is no organised promotion or relegation between leagues, unlike in the National League System, which covers the top few levels of amateur football, although many leagues operate several divisions with promotion and relegation between them. However, ambitious Sunday teams may apply to join a Saturday league for a higher standard of football, and from there graduate to the FA-sanctioned leagues.\",\n      \"votes\": 0,\n      \"topic\": \"football\",\n      \"author\": \"weegembump\",\n      \"created_at\": \"2016-11-18T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"comment_count\": \"14\"\n    }, {\n      \"article_id\": 8,\n      \"title\": \"Express.js: A Server-Side JavaScript Framework\",\n      \"body\": \"You’re probably aware that JavaScript is the programming language most often used to add interactivity to the front end of a website, but its capabilities go far beyond that—entire sites can be built on JavaScript, extending it from the front to the back end, seamlessly. Express.js and Node.js gave JavaScript newfound back-end functionality—allowing developers to build software with JavaScript on the server side for the first time. Together, they make it possible to build an entire site with JavaScript: You can develop server-side applications with Node.js and then publish those Node.js apps as websites with Express. Because Node.js itself wasn’t intended to build websites, the Express framework is able to layer in built-in structure and functions needed to actually build a site. It’s a pretty lightweight framework that’s great for giving developers extra, built-in web application features and the Express API without overriding the already robust, feature-packed Node.js platform. In short, Express and Node are changing the way developers build websites.\",\n      \"votes\": 0,\n      \"topic\": \"coding\",\n      \"author\": \"cooljmessy\",\n      \"created_at\": \"2016-06-30T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"comment_count\": \"7\"\n    }, {\n      \"article_id\": 11,\n      \"title\": \"Designing Better JavaScript APIs\",\n      \"body\": \"At some point or another, you will find yourself writing JavaScript code that exceeds the couple of lines from a jQuery plugin.

There are a variety of open, standardized options, and the ideal choice depends on the applications requirements and pre-existing functionality. For example, SOAP-based web services format the data in an XML payload wrapped within a SOAP envelope. While XML works well for many application scenarios, it has some drawbacks that make it less than ideal for others. One such space where XML is often less than ideal is with Ajax-style web applications. Ajax is a technique used for building interactive web applications that provide a snappier user experience through the use of out-of-band, lightweight calls to the web server in lieu of full-page postbacks. These asynchronous calls are initiated on the client using JavaScript and involve formatting data, sending it to a web server, and parsing and working with the returned data. While most browsers can construct, send, and parse XML, JavaScript Object Notation (or JSON) provides a standardized data exchange format that is better-suited for Ajax-style web applications. JSON is an open, text-based data exchange format (see RFC 4627). Like XML, it is human-readable, platform independent, and enjoys a wide availability of implementations. Data formatted according to the JSON standard is lightweight and can be parsed by JavaScript implementations with incredible ease, making it an ideal data exchange format for Ajax web applications. Since it is primarily a data format, JSON is not limited to just Ajax web applications, and can be used in virtually any scenario where applications need to exchange or store structured information as text. This article examines the JSON standard, its relationship to JavaScript, and how it compares to XML. Jayrock, an open-source JSON implementation for .NET, is discussed and examples of creating and parsing JSON messages are provided in JavaScript and C#.\", \"votes\": 0, \"topic\": \"coding\", \"author\": \"cooljmessy\", \"created_at\": \"2016-10-29T00:00:00.000Z\", \"comment_count\": \"8\" }, { \"article_id\": 35, \"title\": \"Stone Soup\", \"body\": \"The first day I put my family on a Paleolithic diet, I made my kids fried eggs and sausage for breakfast.

I was an advocate of Big Sam’s appointment because of the fact he managed down the league and could see that talent lay beyond just the big clubs in the country. Roy had many faults but the biggest frustration for me was he failed to utilise an already diminished pool of English players by continuing to pick the so called elite players – who are all tainted with failure. To be fair to Allardyce his first England game came so early in the season that it made making whole sale changes difficult. We shall never know if he would have picked different players.

He just didn’t know who to play in left midfield. The player would have to combat Bayern Munich’s brilliant Arjen Robben and Philipp Lahm. Going into the last team meeting, Di Matteo had a private chat with his left-back, Ashley Cole. He outlined the situation, then asked Cole who he would play at left-midfield. Instead of naming a seasoned star, Cole said: “Ryan Bertrand.” The 22-year-old reserve Bertrand had never played in the Champions League, let alone in club football’s biggest game. “Why?” asked Di Matteo, surprised. “I trust him,” replied Cole. Bertrand played well, and Chelsea beat Bayern on penalties. In part, this was a victory for talent management. Di Matteo had put aside his ego, and let trust between two players drive the decision. Talent management has been a business obsession at least since 1997, when the consultancy McKinsey identified a “war for talent”. The most visible battleground of this “war” is team sport. Football, in particular, is “the quintessential model for modern-day talent-dependent business”, writes Chris Brady, professor at Salford Business School. Big football clubs pay more than half their revenues to between 3 and 7 per cent of their workforce: the players. These young men are rich, multinational, mobile, often equipped with large egos and therefore hard to manage.

If we can develop an objective scale which measures the intensity of a press then coaches can quickly see at a glance the strength, or otherwise, of the high pressing that their opposition has utilised in recent games. Teams or fans can also assess how much pressure their team exerted on the opposition in deep positions, and who knows, perhaps in time we will be able to assess the effectiveness that individual players have on the ability of their team to press.

FC Barcelona, also known simply as Barcelona and familiarly as Barça, is based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. The team was founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, English and Spanish footballers led by Joan Gamper. The club played amateur football until 1910 in various regional competitions. In 1910, the club participated in their first of many European competitions, and has since amassed ten UEFA trophies and a sextuple. In 1928, Barcelona co-founded La Liga, the top-tier in Spanish football, along with a string of other clubs. As of 2016, Barcelona has never been relegated from La Liga, a record they share with Athletic Bilbao and arch-rival Real Madrid. The history of Barcelona has often been politically. Though it is a club created and run by foreigners, Barcelona gradually became a club associated with Catalan values. In Spain's transition to autocracy in 1925, Catalonia became increasingly hostile towards the central government in Madrid. The hostility enhanced Barcelona's image as a focal point for Catalonism, and when Francisco Franco banned the use of the Catalan language, the stadium of Barcelona became one of the few places the people could express their dissatisfaction. The Spanish transition to democracy in 1978 has not dampened the club's image of Catalan pride. In the 2000s – a period of sporting success in the club and an increased focus on Catalan players – club officials have openly called for Catalonia to become an independent state.\", \"votes\": 0, \"topic\": \"football\", \"author\": \"weegembump\", \"created_at\": \"2018-02-17T00:00:00.000Z\", \"comment_count\": \"16\" }, { \"article_id\": 27, \"title\": \"Thanksgiving Drinks for Everyone\", \"body\": \"Thanksgiving is a foodie’s favorite holiday.
